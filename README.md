# SP//dr: Poppy Ergo Jr. remote control through creative coding platforms

## What is SP//dr?
SP//dr is a collection of extensions for various creative coding platforms aiming to control a [Poppy Ergo Jr.](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/robots/poppy-ergo-jr/) 6-DOF robotic arm through the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol.

The arm in itself is controlled by an OpenCM 9.04 development board communicating with the Python OSC server through a serial connection.

## Documentation
The documentation is available [on the project's wiki](https://github.com/mcaravati/sp-dr/wiki).
